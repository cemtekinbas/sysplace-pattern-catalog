# Sysplace Pattern Catalog

LaTeX Templates and generation code for the patterns in SysPlace. This is the central place to manage all pattern descriptions. Please do not upload any generated content (e.g. PDF files or websites), just templates and build scripts.

## How to use the build script
- Navigate to the main folder (sysplace-pattern-catalog/)
- source the functions in `build.ps1` by calling `> . .\build.ps1` (Dot-Sourcing)
- now you can call the function on top level as if they were system functions:
 - `> build`
 - `> clean` 
 - etc.
